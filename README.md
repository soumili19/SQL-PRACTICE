# SQL_PRACTICE
This repository contains my daily solutions to SQL query problems. I aim to upload at least two SQL query solutions every day as part of my learning journey.

The problems are primarily taken from the popular SQL50 practice site(The link is given in the about ), which offers a wide range of beginner to intermediate-level SQL challenges.

For each solution, you can find:

✅ The problem description (refer to SQL50 for full details)

✅ The required table structure (refer to SQL50 for full details)

✅ My SQL query solution (refer to SQL50 for full details)

✅ Brief explanation or comments for better understanding

The goal is to strengthen my SQL skills through regular practice on common topics like:

SELECT queries

JOINs

GROUP BY, HAVING

Subqueries

Aggregations and Filtering

Feel free to explore, learn, and contribute!
